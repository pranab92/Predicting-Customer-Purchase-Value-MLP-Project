Description
The goal of this competition is to predict a customerâ€™s purchase value based on their multi-session behavior across digital touchpoints. The dataset captures anonymized user interactions such as browser types, traffic sources, device details, and geographical indicators. By modeling these patterns, participants will estimate the purchase potential of each user, helping optimize marketing and engagement strategies.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on r2_score() between the predicted values and the True target.
